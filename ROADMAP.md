## Technical Milestones

### Architecture Validation Points
1. **Week 4**: EDN query DSL proves effective for basic operations
2. **Week 8**: Kafka integration handles production-like load
3. **Week 12**: gRPC + React demonstrate full-stack capability
4. **Week 16**: Elasticsearch queries match or exceed EDN performance
5. **Week 20**: SDKs enable easy integration for client applications

### Performance Targets
- **Ingestion**: 10K logs/second per instance
- **Query Latency**: <500ms for simple queries, <2s for complex aggregations
- **Storage Efficiency**: <20% overhead vs raw log size
- **UI Responsiveness**: <200ms for dashboard interactions

### Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for all core components
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs and deployment guides
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and audit logging
- **Monitoring**: Full observability of system health and performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Elasticsearch Complexity**: Start with simple mappings, iterate based on query patterns
2. **gRPC-Web Browser Support**: Use Envoy proxy for production deployments
3. **Kafka Operations**: Provide docker-compose setup for easy local development
4. **Query DSL Complexity**: Validate with real-world queries early and often

### Resource Risks
1. **Development Time**: Prioritize MVP features, defer non-essential items
2. **Infrastructure Costs**: Use local development setup, optimize for minimal resource usage
3. **Learning Curve**: Invest in documentation and examples for complex components
